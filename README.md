# Yu-Gi-Oh-Text-Analysis
The objective of this  project is to demonstrate my data slicing skills, as well as cleaning. I also wanted to see any trends that go on with various card types, since it is a common for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Community to think that there has been an increase in card text. I want to use R packages such as quanteda, tidytext, and wordcloud.
